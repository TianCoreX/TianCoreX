Yo! 👋 I’m Tian — a future full-stack dev cooking something cool at **TianCoreX**.

I mix code + logic + dreams to create stuff that actually matters. Right now I’m still learning, but someday... I'm gonna build tech that'll blow minds (and maybe change the game 👾).

If you’re into AI, systems, and quiet brilliance — we’re probably on the same vibe. 🧠⚙️
